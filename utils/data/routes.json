    "description": "This problem is located on a large boulder at the Southeast end of Rock Hudson. Climb a juggy crack on an overhanging arete until it dies out 15 ft. up. Lean out left, onto the overhanging face, to a large flake. Finishes with an easy mantel 25 ft. off the deck. One of JTree's finest problems.",

    "description": "Climb Red House Extension, but don't rock over to the right of the boulder. Instead, utilize a pinch to make a long standup move, and then get a great heel hook that feels much less secure than it actually is. Rock up to a sidepull and make a committing move out left to an incut rail, and finish up the easy topout. This is the same grade as Red House Extension, but adds quite a few more V4-ish moves, and topping out can be scary. A very proud line, and one of the most classic at Stone Fort!",

    "description": "This less popular Moonshine route is just as classic as the others imo. Be prepared for a stout grade and quite a pump for a boulder problem. Start in the shared pockets with the V4 'Moonshine Roof', and climb onto the diving board. Where 'Moonshine Roof' breaks right continue straight and around the corner thru challenging beta intensive moves. Get established under the final roof with a good left hand and enter the crux pulling over the final lip to good holds above. Some toe hook trickey can help to get matched on the final holds before the move to the jugs leading to the topout.",
